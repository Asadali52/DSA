# 8 bits = 1 byte
- so 4 bytes = 32 bits 
=> int data type contains 4 bytes means 32 bits => same for float data type
=> char data type contains 1 byte means 8 bits => same in bool data type
=> double data type contains 8 bytes means 64 bits# dsa


# ASCII Value
A => 65 
B => 66 
C => 67 and so on;

a => 97
b => 98
c => 99


# Remember 
# DECIMAL_NUM  -------> BINARY_FORM
0 => 0
1 => 1
2 => 10
3 => 11
4 => 100
5 => 101
6 => 110
7 => 111
8 => 10000
9 => 1001
10 => 1010
