# 8 bits = 1 byte
- so 4 bytes = 32 bits 
=> int data type contains 4 bytes means 32 bits => same for float data type
=> char data type contains 1 byte means 8 bits => same in bool data type
=> double data type contains 8 bytes means 64 bits# dsa


# ASCII Value
A => 65 
B => 66 
C => 67 and so on;

a => 
b => 
c =>
